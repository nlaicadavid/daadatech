Looking for affordable ANC cans? I tested several under $100 and focused on comfort, ANC strength, mic quality, and battery life.

### ðŸŽ§ Top pick â€” XYZ Model

Trade-offs and who should choose it.

### ðŸŽ§ Best for calls â€” QRS Model
Mic clarity and background noise handling.

## Buying tips
- **ANC quality:** Strong ANC doesnâ€™t always mean best sound.
- **Comfort:** Clamp force + ear pad material matter more than weight alone.
- **Battery:** 30â€“50 hours is the new baseline.

## FAQs
**Are cheap ANC headphones worth it?**  
Yes, if you mainly want airplane/office noise reduction and donâ€™t require audiophile sound.
